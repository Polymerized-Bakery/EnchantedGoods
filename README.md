A datapack thats packaged as a mod to allow modloaders to run it without it having to be added to the world folder

Using Polymer I can also create completely Custom properties for the enchantments

## What's in the mod?

Currently 2 enchantments For armor!

### Ender

- Teleport away/around your enemy when youre hit.
  - More of a curse at this current point, Later it will only activate at low health
  
### Lifesteal

- Eats alot of durability
- Heals you and hurts the enemy when you are hit!
  - at current moment it makes you near invulnerable to most attacks. which is why it is a rare enchantment and expensive.
